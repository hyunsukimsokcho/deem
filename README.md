# Deem

Here's Duplicator and Cleaner component of MLclean for DEEM 2019. If one wants to test each component independently, one absolutely can by following below instructions:
###### Note: So far, I've only roughly implemented Duplicator component. (Mar. 02, 2019)

First of all, `git clone` this project to wherever you want to in your local machine. This project doesn't require you to pre-install any Python libraries.

Once you're done with cloning, on the root of the project(`${path_you_cloned}/deem`), enter the following:
`python Component/${component_name}.py`. I tried to modularize each components so that the execution of each component with diffrent dataset becomes very handy.

### Any feedbacks or code reviews would be very helpful :)
